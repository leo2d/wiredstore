# wiredstore

This project is a virtual store focused on selling keys for digital games, such as Steam or Nuuvem.

It was developed using .NET Core 2.1 with ASP.NET Core MVC, MySql, Entity Framework Core and Razor.

I worked on this project in early 2018, but only now have I migrated from my TFS account to Github.

NOTE: This is a completely academic / POC project.
